# hi mom

My name is Noah and I'm a data scientist and engineer. I have been a CNC programmer/operator, a draftsman/technical designer, a security guard, and a guitar salesman. I was a self-taught hobbyist Python developer for years before making a career change in my 30s.

More recently I have worked for [Galvanize, Inc.](https://www.galvanize.com/), [CMS AI Health Outcomes Challenge](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-selects-winner-and-runner-artificial-intelligence-health-outcomes-challenge) winner [ClosedLoop.ai](https://www.closedloop.ai/), and [top-ranking](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-selects-winner-and-runner-artificial-intelligence-health-outcomes-challenge) ACO REACH [ilumed](https://ilumed.com)

Today I work as a freelance data engineer, scientist, analysit & Python developer, and as a private tutor and coach focusing on python, bash, the UNIX command line, and vim.

If you are interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to reach out:
